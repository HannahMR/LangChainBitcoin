    "This notebook shows some examples of how to use the set of \"tools\" provided in the `LangChainBitcoin` project with the `langchain` project and also the newly announced native function calls provided by the OpenAPI GPt-3/4 APIs. By hooking up Lightning tools directly to the LLM agent, we give it the ability to: interact with the Bitcoin network, hold/send/recv Bitcoin (on-chain or over LN), and also eventually directly mmanage/drive an active node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier versions of the `langchain` project included support for \"tools\" which an agent can use to figure out how to answer a prompt or iterate towards a goal. This was implemented via a series of prompts and chained LLMs to \"teach\" the LLM how to use a set of tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "On June 13th, 2023 [OpenAPI released support for native function calls](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates)! Native function calls can be used to directly give the LLM native tools that it can use. Basic usage of thes function calls can be used to ensure that the agent emits structred data like JSON, which can be difficult produce reliably otherwise. The latest releases of the `langchain` library augment the prior abstractions with direct support for the new function API provided by Open AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the new function call API with `langchain`, and also our custom set of Bitcoin/Lightning tools, we're able to create agents that are able to directly interact with Bitcoin and also the Lightning Network. At a high level, we create some functions implementing tools, then _describe_ these tools to the agent. A description can include a strict schema for the input arguments (`a: string, b: Invoice`, etc) and also some few-shot examples of what a response would look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, we'll demo some basic tools to show how things are initialized, and also how to create and prompt the agent. "
